                    "Now we need to restore the schools, as [restored] the subway." President Shavkat Mirziyoyev announced the need to create conditions in schools, develop fundamental sciences and raise the authority of teachers, which will become "the basis for the third Renaissance." He also said that thanks to the development of geology, for the first time in a year, 20 new mines were opened and 70 tons of gold were mined.

                    Indeed, education is the future of society; the economic situation of the country depends on it. Schools are your economy today, your society tomorrow. Educational policy will always be closely linked to economic policy. No country can achieve economic success without strengthening the skilled workforce base and creating better conditions for professionals in the labor market. That's why I think the two concepts are so close.
